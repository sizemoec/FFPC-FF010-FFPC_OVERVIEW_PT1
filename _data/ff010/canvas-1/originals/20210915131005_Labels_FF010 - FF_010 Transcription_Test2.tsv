1058.815145	1059.542468	Oh yeah.	Transcription
1059.551793	1060.251142	Yeah.	Transcription
1060.251142	1061.743088	You wanted to do it right away, actually.	Transcription
1061.565919	1071.33117	And so I didnt, I didnt do it. And then some of the younger poets started saying, we heard so much about Furious Flower, when are you going to do this	Transcription
1071.214611	1073.207757	Just like we said today, Jo. 	Transcription
1073.61338	1093.017998	Yes, just like [inaudible] said last night, but when is the next one? You know, are youre going to do the next one? Well, I set a date. And so I said, After 10 years 2004. So 2004 the next Furious Flower conference happened. 	Transcription
1093.652074	1117.010348	And the outpouring for that conference was amazing. So we had 50 invited poets. And at each point, Sonia Sanchez was there with me to do Furious Flower. She was there to read on the opening night, on Thursday night with Amiri Baraka. Ill never forget that night.	Transcription
1117.243464	1141.301087	You can go online and see that night. You can go to the, the videos. And you can-- honestly, these are still available, at California Newsreel. If you buy them. This is what-- who testified to this last night. Somebody said, you know about having these to have in the class, and to- 	Transcription
1141.301087	1142.084359	Oh, that was me.	Transcription
1142.084359	1145.086899	Yeah, today, yeah. You said that. 	Transcription
1145.086899	1146.373702	Ill second that emotion.	Transcription
1146.373702	1169.927793	Yeah, thats right. Okay. So those videos, I realized that a lot of schools would not have the resources, or the wherewithal to bring Sonia to their school. So if they can go and get a clip of Sonia talking about her work, hear, her reading her poems, then that would be second best.	Transcription
1170.076988	1193.369989	And so we did those videos and, and I love that we came up with the titles, Elders, Warriors, Seers, Initiates. Because there were four generations of poets at the first conference. At the second conference, there were certainly at least four generations.	Transcription
1193.463235	1210.937648	The second conference was dedicated to none other than Sonia Sanchez and Amiri Baraka. Does any, who remembers what happened, that was controversial, at the second?	Transcription
1209.80004	1210.8817	Oh, I dont know. 	Transcription
1211.068193	1212.485542	Okay, go on. 	Transcription
1212.485542	1213.753695	Oh, I dont remember what was controvertial.	Transcription
1213.753695	1215.655926	Okay, all right, go on [inaudible].	Transcription
1215.655926	1232.179224	Well, are you talking about-- I may not have this exactly right, but I think, um, Thomas Sayers Ellis got angry about a mention of Henry Louis Gates,  	Transcription
1232.27247	1248.851716	I think Baraka was on stage, and he said something about Gates, And some people-- it wasnt only Ellis but I was sitting near him-- some people in the audience kind of took umbrage and got noisy, and that was one thing.	Transcription
1248.870365	1252.525632	That was one thing, and see I, theres history out there that I dont even know.	Transcription
1252.525632	1261.421357	Yeah, well, I remember that one, because it was hard for like, Baraka to finish the reading, people were like, you know, and then people would talk in between.	Transcription
1261.216215	1262.857355	So, that was one thing.	Transcription
1261.477305	1262.917965	Okay, alright.	Transcription
1262.857355	1263.463458	Opal.	Transcription
1263.985639	1288.332326	So I got a telephone call from Joanne one morning. She was on her way to the presidents office, because a group of students were organizing, reportedly organizing a protest against Amiri Baraka being invited to the second Furious Flower. So, Joanne, just, had to-- 	Transcription
1288.416248	1290.383751	Because of the poem.	Transcription
1290.383751	1294.766342	Because of the poem, because of the poem he wrote, following 9-11.	Transcription
1294.766342	1297.451844	Somebody Blew up America.	Transcription
1296.158554	1319.980222	Somebody Blew up America. So the students, of course, I think it was useful, for them to do that. But what was interesting, and what I think, is powerful in the story is that Joanne, of course, knew that she was not going to retract the invitation to Amiri Baraka. So that was understood.	Transcription
1320.259962	1349.655953	But she was thinking through the ways, being both a Professor, being herself, being a poet, being a teacher, and also being a member of a variety of communities, she was thinking about the ways that she would make it clear that while the students protests could take place, that Amiri Baraka would be coming.	Transcription
1349.674602	1379.322359	So I remember that she and I, I know that you called [inaudible] before  you went to meet the president, to talk about what kind of understanding should we bring to the situation. So, so I know that the controversy then was on the campus, but what was interesting was that when Amiri Baraka came and presented, there were-- I was in that audience and I noticed that certain, certain people refused to stand when, and participate in his standing ovation. 	Transcription
1379.620748	1406.680911	But the house stood for Amiri Baraka. I noted a number of people (of course I couldnt have known them), but I noted a number of people who sat. Very pointedly not standing. So that was a very important point of contention around the right of a poet to speak, the right of Amiri Baraka to tell the story that he needed to tell, through that poem and other poems, 	Transcription
1406.830106	1427.139215	but also, the right for students to engage in a conversation and a discussion around something that they thought they needed to speak about. And then, the other part is the magazine article that followed, where a number of voices were published around this issue.	Transcription
1427.139215	1451.401981	And so I think that all of these things, I mean, in terms of talking about a teaching tool, even some of the sidebar information that surrounds these kinds of conferences are very useful teaching tools, just around poetry, around, around freedom of speech, around truth-telling. And, and also I would say, around doing your homework if youre gonna protest something.	Transcription
1451.401981	1477.604275	Yeah, exactly. Well, you know, I was very fortunate to have amazing mentors. And Gwendolyn Brooks was a mentor. Margaret Walker was a mentor. Sonia Sanchez, my sister, and I remember the, the year I came to James Madison University. 	Transcription
1478.592689	1501.009172	I had just gotten here. And Sonia called me and she was screaming on the telephone. And she was screaming because police in Philadelphia had dropped bombs on MOVE.	Transcription
1501.34486	1510.054092	And she was just saying, you know, in fact, it was it was no, it was it was just before I got here. It was in April wasnt it?  	Transcription
1510.054092	1511.005207	It was in May.	Transcription
1511.005207	1535.696907	May, okay. May, okay. It was just before I came, I knew we were coming. Our furniture was already going to be moved. I was just getting ready to go to Virginia. And, you know, when you, when something like that happens, and when you understand that authorities can make you do a lot if you are scared. 	Transcription
1536.405581	1556.891859	But I had such peace. I called my Wintergreen sisters, I had such peace about what I was going to do. This was just a month before the conference was supposed to happen. It was in August that this controversy started. It was to honor Sonia and Amiri.	Transcription
1557.731079	1573.676247	I made up in my mind that if the president would ask me to disinvite Amiri  Baraka, then I would call the entire conference off.	Transcription
1574.82318	1595.001745	And, that would have been a rough call, but it wouldve been the the only call I could have made. And thats why I wanted support, I wanted to hear people talk about what they thought, but I made up in my mind that if you have any principle, you have to stand on principle.	Transcription
1595.430679	1620.08508	Why? If they can ask me to disinvite Amiri Baraka, because of a poem-- Somebody Blew up America-- then they can ask me to disinvite Nicki Giovanni because of her poems, written in the 1960s, or Sonias poems, or Rita Doves poems.	Transcription
1620.08508	1634.818043	If you find something that you dont like, about their political point of view, then no one is safe, and so I was not going to do that. So I was gonna make-- even though we have put in a years worth of work.	Transcription
1635.601314	1657.40237	And so thats a sidebar. But thats an important one. Its an important one, because you in your own careers will have to make decisions that are tough decisions. And they will have to do, be based on principles that you hold dear. And if you sell out on one principle, youll sell out on all of them. Yeah, go on, [inaudible]	Transcription
1657.40237	1658.558627	Oh no, Im just agreeing with you.	Transcription
1658.558627	1660.442209	Oh okay, but you were putting your hand up.	Transcription
1660.442209	1661.533194	No I, Im just, you know.	Transcription
1661.533194	1675.650729	Alright. Okay. Alright well, we, you know, I can go through this really quickly, because I would love for you to get your voice in it. You know, I really, I really wanted you to do that. 	Transcription
1675.650729	1684.95674	So 2004, 2004, the conference is available entirely on DVD.	Transcription
1686.066374	1686.924243	2004?	Transcription
1687.026814	1708.40826	2004. The entire conference, or the, I suppose, not, well the  entire conference is available on, now, this MDID, which is on the website. So you can go there under most circumstances, and click on it-- I dont know whats going on with this site.	Transcription
1707.736884	1708.725298	Oh, I do	Transcription
1708.725298	1709.303427	What?	Transcription
1709.005038	1719.579203	The guy came in here and one of, one of the JMU (I totally forgot until just now) One of the JMU employees unfortunately clicked on a virus, and so it is now in our system.	Transcription
1719.075671	1720.362474	It has a virus on it.	Transcription
1721.257641	1738.433665	And he was in here, I would like to say about 15 minutes before you came in here. Yeah, but not the person that clicked but the person trying to correct. So he may have begun to correct but they may-- it may be something going through the system now. System wide. Im sorry, I totally forgot.	Transcription
1738.433665	1748.690791	Okay. Well, you know what, lets cut, Lets cut it off. Yeah, we can cut it off. We did see some of the pictures, and then that will get rid of that static.	Transcription
1753.334472	1780.599778	I think that its wonderful that youve done that. I was trying to convince my school to buy, well, the first tapes. And then when I went online, and I teach strictly online, it didnt become a pressing issue for me because it was only for my selfish needs. You know, the faculty, what they needed. But now, I can use the website as part of my class instead of directing them right to Youtube, to find clips. Its very helpful.	Transcription
