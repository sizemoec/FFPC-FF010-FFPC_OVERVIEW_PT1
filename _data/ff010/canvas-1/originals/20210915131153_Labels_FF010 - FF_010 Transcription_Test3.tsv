1780.599778	1805.328776	Thats right. Thats right. So those conferences are available, now on the internet, as well as from California Newsreel. In California Newsreel, you have the conversations that you will not find between the poets and other poets or critics, and you have their readings, which are invaluable.	Transcription
1805.328776	1827.512548	So just listen to the people who are on the DVD for 2004. Sonia Sanchez, Rita Dove, Amiri Baraka, Lucille Clifton, Askia Tour??, Haki Madhubuti, just to name a few. They are, theyre there. But there were 25, there are 25 on here. 	Transcription
1827.747691	1855.212464	Okay, fast forward. After 2004 and that conference Linwood Rose, realized that we had something going here. And I still directed the Honors Program. Working on this, these conferences on the side, I still had a full time job teaching my courses. But on the side, I put together these conferences. 	Transcription
1855.750482	1876.046187	I decided that, okay, we could have a center. And I went to him with a proposal. And he, in his infinite wisdom, decided to give us about $100,000 to start the Furious Flower Poetry Center. 	Transcription
1876.046187	1888.814484	As I said, things have changed. I had the support of the first President Ronald Carrier for the first conference. For the second conference, I had the support of the president, President Linwood Rose.	Transcription
1888.814484	1913.974849	In fact, just a footnote, to that story about Amiri Baraka. Dr. Rose decided, if there was only one event that he was going to go to, it was going to be the reading of Amiri Baraka. And he went to that reading, and he sent me an email afterwards and said, what was the big deal? He didnt hear anything that he was offended by.	Transcription
1913.974849	1940.193361	Now talk about historical vindication. Who comes out with an entire book about what was known before 9-11? In the Congressional Record. So if we, if we silence our-- if we allow our posts to be silenced, we will live in a very dangerous world.	Transcription
1940.193361	1941.016364	Also,	Transcription
1941.557194	1964.624781	And as an aside, if you allow the younger poets to disrespect the elder poets then thered be danger to society and that should be noted, finally, as an aside, only as an Elder Im saying it. you know, at some point, it has got to be addressed. You could disagree with what Baraka says, but you dont disrespect the Elder. And I watched people, the younger poets disrespect him,	Transcription
1964.624781	1987.26911	you know, and I almost got up and said something, then I said no its Joannes, you know, its been enough uproar here already. But send a sign as teachers, you know, and professors, that you really have got to insist, you know, at some point, that you can come on a different level of how you write and why you write and what youre about, you know, and youre not political, but-- and etcetera.	Transcription
1987.26911	2007.514974	But still, you know, we disagreed with some of the older poets. I mean, I know, I was, Ill never forget, and I told you about this, I got a long letter about... three letters, from different departments about people who were up for tenure. The people who wrote it knew that we were completely different politically.	Transcription
2007.514974	2035.732206	Now you have to hear that. And I got these letters, you know, and the calls saying wed like you to write a recommendation, bla bla bla bla bla. And I said, certainly, so I wrote the recommendation, positive [inaudible]. And then I got a call that said Oh, you wrote a positive recommendation, they expected me to blast the person. No, we got to hear this. Because Im saying to you young people, you cannot blast people you disagree with. You cannot do it, you know, it is immoral to do it.	Transcription
2035.732206	2048.006702	It is immoral. I dont care what, I dont like her, I dont like him. No, no, no, no, no. That person has a right to have a tenured position just as you have a right, you cannot do that.	Transcription
2048.006702	2069.216654	And thats the thing that, as an aside, a major aside that Id like to see us talk about is that sometimes you know how we allow that kind of, opinion of people to have-- and people write terrible recommendations. Ive read that myself, about people you know, they dont know Ive read them, and then I look and say how can you do that to another human being.	Transcription
2069.216654	2087.934085	And I think thats important, you know, and so one was Gloria Oden. I dont know if you remember Gloria Oden the poet. You know, she was in Maryland. I get it. But we want you to write this whatever. They knew that Gloria has said some things about the younger poets, you know, me and my group at the time.	Transcription
2087.934085	2112.247933	And I wrote her, you know, she was being in quotes promoted and getting this forever. I wrote a glowing, recommendation, and they actually called me and said, well. Did you understand that she was up? --I said, oh yes, yes I did, isnt that wonderful that shell get it. Thats what Im talking about, that kind of reality. When people write to you thinking you dont like her, youre going to perform an immoral act by not supporting her or him. 	Transcription
2112.247933	2128.096612	And Im saying to you as younger professors you cant do it, you cannot do it, you must not do it. Because when you do that you commit an immoral act and have said simply, that we are still separate from each other, and they will continue to separate us.I just wanted to say that. 	Transcription
2127.109009	2130.589134	Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yes?	Transcription
2129.178273	2152.457489	Can I add something to that? And the reason why I said, Sonia, that I thought it was fortunate that the young people raised that issue, is that I knew that Joanne would handle it. But sometimes in these same situations where the conversation doesnt get to the foreground, where the conversation remains in the background. 	Transcription
2152.457489	2165.202272	It never gets to be addressed, and so the person who does that thinks that they have accomplished something. So in other words, I mean, I feel that in terms of our struggle for... 	Transcription
2165.202272	2166.942335	I wasnt talking about the students here.	Transcription
2166.942335	2168.541311	Yeah, yeah I understand.	Transcription
2168.541311	2189.422063	The students, they had a right to do what they did, theyre students here. No, I was talking about the right, the younger poets, thats different, who came in here, who were invited in here, and they disrespected him. Thats what I was talking about. and Im saying you as younger writers dont have a right to disrespect people. Because weve had a long group of people that we have differed, in terms of politics,	Transcription
2189.422063	2216.745749	but the thing that we did not do is that we did not disrespect them. And you cant do it, and you do not do underhanded things. You know, whatever. Because when people see that they know there is real division. You can disagree, but you do it quietly. But you do not say no, Im not going to write a recommendation for this person, because I dont like his politics or her politics. Thats immoral, thats an immoral act, there, you know, and thats what I was talking about.	Transcription
2216.745749	2219.144214	Thank you. Becky.	Transcription
2219.144214	2232.053598	I think part of the way that this disrespect gets institutionalized is that faculty are allowed to write blind reviews, for journals and for tenure and for promotion. And,	Transcription
2232.570914	2254.862527	so I always put my name on everything. My feeling is, if you cant put your name on a letter, and have it be public you shouldnt be writing that. If you cant say it right to someones face, you shouldnt be writing that. And sometimes Ive had journals, and tenure committees you know, try to cut my name out, so I put the name right in the text. Because, that stuff, it is--	Transcription
2253.874924	2274.332417	But those are private things, because they dont have to come out. When, when you write a letter of recommendation, or not recommendation, thats in a private thing that does not come out anyway. And you cannot petition that. You cannot thats, this is academe, and you cannot whatever, but what Im saying, is that they know that, I mean, thats completely different.	Transcription
2274.332417	2296.45943	But, you write a recommendation, say Im writing one for you, you know, goes in and whatever. They dont, they dont have to release that to you to say what I said at all. And you might think, gee, shes my friend, shes wrote a great, great thing for me or whatever. But you never ever see it, you know, period. Thats what Im talking about. And thats that, and thats why people do it. Because they know that it never gets seen. You know, thats exactly why they do it. 	Transcription
2298.483646	2329.614677	Well, you know, thank thank you for that. You know, and it was, for me, one of those moments that you look back on, and you say, okay, that incident defined my character. And I didnt share that with you so that you can pat me on the back, I share it with you, because were going to come up against, youre going to come up against some really tough decisions, if you try to do good. 	Transcription
2331.237168	2359.148714	You know, and so that was just mine. That was just mine. Well, the good things that came out of the conferences... Not only the videos, but some of you know about The Furious Flowering of African American Poetry from the University of Virginia Press. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It took me a while. This was the reason I had that first conference, in the first place,	Transcription
2359.407372	2386.331314	because a friend of mine, Trudy Harris, another Wintergreen Women woman said, I would love to teach African American poetry but you know what, I cant find the critical texts to help me teach the poetry because her area was basically fiction and but she, you know, she, you know, Trudy Harris, shes a brilliant woman, she can teach anything. But she, so I said, Well, Ill have this conference and maybe I can get them to publish some of their conference papers. 	Transcription
2386.331314	2412.432254	And sure enough conversations, articles-- including Denises interview with Gwendolyn Brooks, is in this collection. Now, the second-- 2004 just before the conference happened, University of Virginia press put out the Furious Flower... um--	Transcription
2416.171037	2440.814086	Not that Ive had so many books that I dont know the titles, but I had to find out. Furious Flower: African American Poetry from the Black Arts Movement to the Present. This is an anthology that came out in hardback and paperback, the year of 2004. And I know some of you are using that. So those are texts that are now on the shelves that you can use.	Transcription
2440.908144	2465.809851	Then, as a part of the conference, and tomorrow youre going to be going to the 150 Franklin Street gallery, where youre going to see the actual piece of art that was commissioned for 2004, for that conference. Some of you-- How many of you have seen that? How many of you, you Okay, you came back, so youll get to see it again.	Transcription
2465.809851	2483.704279	But our, because of that particular painting, and you saw that magazine of me with my face on it. Okay, thats in the background. All right. But, when you have something great, people want to jump on the bandwagon.	Transcription
2484.762425	2504.538002	Pomegranate, the leading poster and card company in the country, did a calendar that had the images of the --some of--12 of the poets on that quilt. And I didnt bring the calendar, but I did bring the cards.	Transcription
2504.984775	2533.789866	And these cards were done-- there were just four of them done, and they picked the image of Rita Dove, to put on the on the front of the box, Gwendolyn Brooks, Langston Hughes, and Claude McKay. But these cards are now out there. And, and the calendar had the dates of birthdays of at least 200 poets, African American poets.	Transcription
2533.789866	2561.74844	I mean, their birthdays are there maybe, no, its probably 365, but, well close to that. And the cards were a part of that particular project. To move on really quickly. That was 2004. These cards, these cards of the calendar came out 2006. In 2005, what major event happened? 	Transcription
2564.711249	2565.651824	Katrina.	Transcription
2564.711249	2566.604155	I really hadnt,	Transcription
2566.898085	2595.091802	What? Katrina, Katrina. How many of you were a part of the Katrina project? Alright, yes, yes. Five days-- and I told you some of this yesterday. Five days after the hurricane hit the gulf, I decided that Furious Flower had to do something relevant. And so this whole idea of Mourning Katrina was hatched.	Transcription
2595.656147	2609.341504	And, and the project was basically, I wanted people to respond to the tragedy of Katrina, by writing poetry about it.	Transcription
2611.293196	2634.29024	And so we sent out booklets, little pads, the computers, were not going to work. So we sent out to poets all over the country, and especially in the gulf, pads, and paper, and said, have your children, have your adults write a poem about how Katrina affected them.	Transcription
2635.136757	2657.969201	And do you know, over the next three or four months, we got back at least 200 poems, or, or pieces of verse, from children as young as four to people as old as 80. And I must tell you, that the response was so overwhelming,	Transcription
2658.227859	2678.520752	that the first part of the project was just to have them write. And then I wanted, if I got the poem, to send out to my friends in the country, a few of these poems, and I wanted them to respond to the people who wrote the poems. So they would know that they were not alone.	Transcription
2678.920496	2700.45965	And Opal was a part of that. She was one of the people responding to these children or to these adults. The work was so dramatic and so worthwhile, That the first project we did as a result of the Morning Katrina project, was something called My Soul is Angered. 	Transcription
2700.647765	2726.395989	We got people in this community to read, on microphone, 25 of the poems that were selected from the 200-and-some that I got. And it was interesting. Thats the way I first met Becky Thompson.	Transcription
2726.795733	2750.074949	Becky, come up here and help me with this a little bit. On the CD that we put together, we have these poets reading-- Becky, I didnt know her. And I couldnt gather together people to read these poems.	Transcription
2750.074949	2769.098067	So I just got local people who wanted to give voice to the poem, and opportunity to read. And then I combined it with gospel music. So thats what this tape is all about. Could you find yours? And read your poem? Thank you.	Transcription
2794.164374	2813.44615	So as I said, I didnt meet Becky until yesterday. But shes been involved in this project since 2005. So her poem was one of the poems read on the CD, and also her poem was put into the volume. 	Transcription
2813.44615	2817.420076	Which I didnt know until a couple of months ago when you and I talked on the phone.	Transcription
2817.420076	2818.149022	Oh, you didnt know it?	Transcription
2818.149022	2821.535089	No. And then you sent me this book, I had not seen the book. This is great.	Transcription
2823.063523	2824.591956	Well you mustve moved because, 	Transcription
2824.591956	2826.978664	Yeah I had, more than once, but yeah.	Transcription
2825.309144	2826.20269	Yeah, okay.	Transcription
2826.978664	2829.729844	Yeah, thats why you didnt get it. Because, yeah.	Transcription
2829.3301	2852.879731	So, how this poem came about in part is that I was writing a book at the time with Dianne Hereford who teaches at Vassar College, who was one, who got you the [inaudible]. And we were writing about whether or not conservative African American leaders still have double consciousness. We were using DuBois work to try to understand what went on with Katrina. 	Transcription
2853.26184	2879.86246	And so this poem thats, uh, sequenced Tankas that I really learned from you, Sonia, was a distilled message from the two chapters in the book that was then called When the Center is on Fire: Passionate Social Theory for our Times. And Diane is also the first African American woman to get full professorship in the history of Vassar College. Amazing.	Transcription
